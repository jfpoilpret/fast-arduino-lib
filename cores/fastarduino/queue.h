	/**
	 * Queue of type @p T_ items.
	 * This is a FIFO (*first in first out*) queue, built upon a ring buffer of 
	 * fixed size, passed at construction time.
	 * 
	 * This queue offers only a few operations:
	 * - push an item at "the end" of the queue
	 * - pull an item from "the beginning" of the queue
	 * - clear the whole queue
	 * - get various information without changing the queue, including peeking
	 * one or several items from the beginning of the queue without removing them
	 * 
	 * All operations exist in two flavors:
	 * - **synchronized**: you should use this flavor whenever the caller cannot 
	 * guarantee no interruption will occur during the operation, i.e. when the caller
	 * is neither part of an ISR, nor embedded itself in a `synchronized` block.
	 * - **not synchronized**: you should use this flavor when the caller can guarantee
	 * that no interruption will occur during the operation, e.g. when called from
	 * an ISR or from within a `synchronized` block; these methods bear the same
	 * name as their **synchronized** counterparts, with an additional trailing
	 * **_** underscore.
	 * 
	 * @tparam T_ the type of items in this queue
	 * @tparam TREF_ the constant reference type of items in this queue; this is
	 * `const T_&` by default, but this may be changed, for small size types
	 * (one or two bytes long) to `T_` itself, in order to avoid additional code
	 * to handle reference extraction of an item. This type is used by `push()`
	 * methods.
