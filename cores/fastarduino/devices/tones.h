	 * This is a rather low-level API. If you want to play suites of tones ("melodies"),
	 * then you should better use `devices::audio::TonePlayer`.
	 * Most provided methods come in two flavours:
	 * - one that takes a `Tone` argument (that will be converted to a note frequency)
	 * - one that takes a TimerPrescaler and a counter value, that will be used to
	 * generate the note frequency from raw timer values.
	 * The first flavour is more readable but less efficient (code size and performance).
	 * The second flavour allows for performance optimization (compile-time calculations)
	 * but is less easy to read and understand.
	 * 
	 * @tparam NTIMER the AVR timer to use for the underlying Timer
	 * @tparam OUTPUT the `board::PWMPin` connected to the buzzer;
	 * this must be the pin OCnA, where n is the AVR Timer number
