/**
 * @file 
 * General API for handling AVR interrupt vectors.
 * In FastArduino, ISR management is performed in 1 or 2 steps:
 * 
 * 1. Declare the ISR itself, in your program, by using one of `REGISTER_XXX` macros
 * provided by FastArduino API; these macros always come in 2 flavours, described later.
 * These macros *define* the ISR function and perform a callback to your code.
 * 2. If you used a `REGISTER_XXX_ISR_METHOD` macro flavour, then you need to register
 * the instance of the class that contains the callback method; this is done with
 * `interrupt::register_handler()`. This method may sometimes be wrapped inside FastArduino
 * API, hence you do not always need to call it yourself.
 * 
 * There are 2 flavours of each registration macro:
 * 
 * 1. `REGISTER_XXX_ISR_FUNCTION`: this flavour defines an ISR for the *"XXX"* signal
 * with callback to a global (or static) function defined in your own program. This may 
 * be useful in simple situations where your callback function does not need any
 * context to perform its task; if your function needs to access some context, then
 * this can only be achieved with global volatile variables, which is not a recommended
 * practice.
 * 2. `REGISTER_XXX_ISR_METHOD`: this flavour defines an ISR for the *"XXX"* signal
 * with callback to a member function of a class. The instance of this class must later
 * be registered with `interrupt::register_handler()` so that the defined ISR can find
 * it when it gets executed.
 * 
 * Note that some FastArduino API define a 3rd flavour of registration macro where
 * you don't need to specify a callback function or method, because this callback 
 * is implicitly defined by the API, e.g. `REGISTER_WATCHDOG_CLOCK_ISR()` defines
 * the necessary ISR for `watchdog::Watchdog` to be notified of watchdog timeouts
 * so that it can update its internal clock counter and generate events.
 * 
 * The rationale behind this approach to register ISR and clallbacks is based on the 
 * following principles:
 * - you decide what ISR you want to use, FastArduino will not impose it to you
 * - you may override FastArduino default ISR if you need to
 * - ISR callbacks may be any function or any method of any class: FastArduino will 
 * not force you to subclass one of its own classes in order to override some 
 * `virtual` method. Calling `virtual` methods from an ISR has an impact on the
 * size and speed of this ISR (all AVR registers must be pushed to the stack even
 * though only a few of them may be used by the overridden method).
 * 
 * Most macros defined in this file are normally not used directly by your programs,
 * they are low-level and used by other higher-level macros defined in each FastArduino
 * specific APIs.
 * These macros are documented for the sake of completeness and in the rare cases where
 * you might need them.
