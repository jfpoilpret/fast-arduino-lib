# Makefile inspired by https://gist.github.com/maxtruxa/4b3929e118914ccef057f8a05c614b0f
# Adapted for FastArduino library and projects
#
# This must be included by your own Makefile for building a library
# This is actually used for fastarduino library itself.

# Find path of this Makefile before including other makefiles in the same path
