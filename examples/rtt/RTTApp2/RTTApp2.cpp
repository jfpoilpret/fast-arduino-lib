/*
 * Real Time Timer example. Take #2
 * This program shows usage of FastArduino Timer-based RTT (Real Time Timer) support.
 * It checks RTT with the timer that can awake from sleep mode, for the target board.
 * The program blinks a LED at a period of 10 seconds, forever.
 * 
 * This examples differs from RTTApp1 in that it sleeps to POWER_SAVE mode, thus reducing energy consumption.
 * 
 * Wiring:
 * - on Arduino UNO and Arduino MEGA:
 *   - no wiring needed as the program uses default LED on D13
 * - on ATmega328P based boards:
 *   - D13 (PB5) connected to a LED through a 330Ohm resistor then linked to GND
 * - on ATtinyX4 based boards:
 *   - D7 (LED, PA7) connected to a LED through a 330Ohm resistor then linked to GND
