/*
 * This program is the Hello World of Arduino: blink LED on D13.
 * It checks FastArduino FastPin support.
 * So far this is just an active loop with a active wait delay.
 * 
 * Wiring:
 * - on ATmega328P based boards (including Arduino UNO):
 *   - D13 (PB5) LED connected to ground through a resistor
 * - on Arduino MEGA:
 *   - D13 (PB7) LED connected to ground through a resistor
 * - on ATtinyX4 based boards:
 *   - D7 (PA7) LED connected to ground through a resistor
