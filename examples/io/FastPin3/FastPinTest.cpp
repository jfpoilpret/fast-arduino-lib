/*
 * This program is the Hello World of Arduino: blink LEDs in sequence.
 * It checks FastArduino FastPort support.
 * So far this is just an active loop with a busy loop wait delay.
 * 
 * Wiring:
 * - on ATmega328P based boards (including Arduino UNO):
 *   - D0-D7 (port D) branch 8 LED (in series with 330 Ohm resistors to limit current) connected to ground
 * - on Arduino LEONARDO:
 *	- D3-D2-D0-D1-D4-TXLED-D12-D6 (port D) branch 8 LED (except for TXLED) in series with 330 Ohm resistors
 * - on Arduino MEGA:
 *   - D22-D29 (port A) branch 8 LED (in series with 330 Ohm resistors to limit current) connected to ground
 * - on ATtinyX4 based boards:
 *   - D0-D7 (port A) branch 8 LED (in series with 330 Ohm resistors to limit current) connected to ground
 * - on ATmega644 based boards:
 *   - D16-D23 (port C) branch 8 LED (in series with 330 Ohm resistors to limit current) connected to ground
