 * FastIO LED chaser.
 * This program shows usage of FastArduino FastIO API with masked ports.
 * 
 * Wiring:
 * - on ATmega328P based boards (including Arduino UNO):
 *   - D0-D7 (port D) branch 8 LED (in series with 330 Ohm resistors to limit current) connected to ground
 * - on Arduino MEGA:
 *   - D22-D29 (port A) branch 8 LED (in series with 330 Ohm resistors to limit current) connected to ground
 * - on ATtinyX4 based boards:
 *   - D0-D7 (port A) branch 8 LED (in series with 330 Ohm resistors to limit current) connected to ground
