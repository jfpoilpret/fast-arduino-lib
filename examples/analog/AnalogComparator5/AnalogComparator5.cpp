 * Analog Comparator example.
 * This program shows usage of FastArduino AnalogComparator API.
 * It performs several comparisons phases:
 * - compare AIN0 with A0
 * - compare BGP with A0
 * 
 * Wiring:
 * - on ATmega328P based boards (including Arduino UNO):
 *   - D6 (AIN0): connected to the wiper of a 10K pot or trimmer, which terminals are connected between Vcc and Gnd
 *   - A0: connected to the wiper of a 10K pot or trimmer, which terminals are connected between Vcc and Gnd
 *   - D13 (LED): internal Arduino LED
 * - on Arduino LEONARDO:
 *   - D7 (AIN0): connected to the wiper of a 10K pot or trimmer, which terminals are connected between Vcc and Gnd
 *   - A0: connected to the wiper of a 10K pot or trimmer, which terminals are connected between Vcc and Gnd
 *   - D13 (LED): internal Arduino LED
 * - on ATtinyX4 based boards:
 *   - D1 (PA1, AIN0): connected to the wiper of a 10K pot or trimmer, which terminals are connected between Vcc and Gnd
 *   - A0 (PA0): connected to the wiper of a 10K pot or trimmer, which terminals are connected between Vcc and Gnd
 *   - D7 (PA7, LED): LED in series with 330 Ohm resistor, connected to ground
 * - on ATtinyX5 based boards:
 *   - D0 (PB0, AIN0): connected to the wiper of a 10K pot or trimmer, which terminals are connected between Vcc and Gnd
 *   - A1 (PB2): connected to the wiper of a 10K pot or trimmer, which terminals are connected between Vcc and Gnd
 *   - D4 (PB4): LED in series with 330 Ohm resistor, connected to ground
 * - on ATmega644 based boards:
 *   - D10 (PB2, AIN0): connected to the wiper of a 10K pot or trimmer, which terminals are connected between Vcc and Gnd
 *   - A0 (PA0): connected to the wiper of a 10K pot or trimmer, which terminals are connected between Vcc and Gnd
 *   - D8 (PB0): LED in series with 330 Ohm resistor, connected to ground
