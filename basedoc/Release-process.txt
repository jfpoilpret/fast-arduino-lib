FastArduino 1.6 release

I am happy to announce the 7th major release of FastArduino platform.

Since release 1.5 (January 2020), the main changes are listed [there](https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib/milestone/8?closed=1).

This release brings the following improvements:
- New API for "future" concept
- New API for "lifecycle" concept and dynamic proxies
- Global rework of the I2C support in order to allow asynchronous handling (on ATmega architecture only)
- Small improvements to Timer API
- Slight improvements to API of GPIO, PCI and PWM
- New "test" namespace with a few helper function used by some FastArduino test examples

Note that I2C API changes are unfortunately not fully compatible with existing programs:
1. If your program uses FastArduino provided I2C devices, then small adaptations will be needed. All examples have been adapted to show these changes.
2. If you have defined your own I2C device support, then you are out of luck: you will have to rewrite most of it, as I2C device API is now based on the new "future" concept.

Other API changes shall have no impact on existing programs.

FastArduino 1.5 release

I am happy to announce the 6th major release of FastArduino platform.

Since release 1.4 (September 2019), the main changes are listed [there](https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib/milestone/7?closed=1).

This release brings the following improvements:
- Rework project directory structure to reduce the number of files in project's root directory
- Update make system to add support for USBtinyISP programmer
- Add documentation for adding support for new I2C and SPI devices
- Improve GPIO and PCI API to ease declaration of FastPin and PCISignal instances 
([issue #74](https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib/issues/74) thanks [hreintke](https://github.com/hreintke) for this excellent suggestion). 
- Add support for MCP23008 GPIO expander (similar to MCP23017)
- Add support for MCP3x0x ADC chips family (note that only the MCP3008 chip has been tested; support for other chips has been implemented but could not be tested as I do not have these chips)
- Fix API documentation issues with some badly generated namespaces

Almost all API changes are compatible with existing programs. Note that if you use MCP23017 device, its namespace has been renamed from 
`mcp23017` to `mcp230xx` (this new namespace is shared between `MCP23017` and `MCP23008` devices).

Known bugs and requests for enhancements: https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib/issues

The platform is well documented:

- a [tutorial](http://jfpoilpret.github.io/fast-arduino-lib/tutorial.html) allows developers to discover and learn the platform step by step

FastArduino 1.4 release

I am happy to announce the 5th major release of FastArduino platform.

Since release 1.3 (September 2019), the main changes are listed [there](https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib/releases/tag/v1.4).

This release brings the following new features and enhancements:
- Add support for Timer Input Capture Noise Canceler
- Add support for Analog Comparator feature
- Improve tone player API to support simpler transcription of music scores: durations are now based on music theory (whole notes, 
half notes, dotted notes...); ties, slurs and triplets are also supported; now you can provide a tempo (`bpm`) to the play API.

Also, in this release, an effort was made to clean up C++ code by explicitly adding declarations for copy constructors and assignment operators.

Do note the following API changes that break compatibility with programs developed with FastArduino 1.3:

- `devices::audio::TonePlay` and `devices::audio::QTonePlay`: these structs do not embed durations in milliseconds any more; 
they now use the new `devices::audio::Duration` enum to use music theory notes durations (whole notes, quarters, quavers...)
- `devices::audio::TonePlayer` and `devices::audio::TonePlayer`: additional argument `bpm` (beats per minute) to all `play_XXXX()` methods.

All features have been tested on all supported targets.

Known bugs and requests for enhancements: https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib/issues

The platform is well documented:

- a [tutorial](http://jfpoilpret.github.io/fast-arduino-lib/tutorial.html) allows developers to discover and learn the platform step by step
- FastArduino core API is documented through doxygen and documentation is published [here](http://jfpoilpret.github.io/fast-arduino-lib/)
- FastArduino comes with many examples covering all supported features and devices

I hope you'll enjoy playing with FastArduino platform; please submit enhancements you would like 
to see in future versions or report issues you may discover.



FastArduino 1.3 release

I am happy to announce the 4th major release of FastArduino platform.

Since release 1.2 (June 2019), the main changes are listed [there](https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib/releases/tag/v1.3).

This is mainly a release with bug fixes, but it also brings afew enhancements.

Do note the following API changes that break compatibility with programs developed with FastArduino 1.2:

- `devices::audio::ToneGenerator`: API removed or updated (no more duration handled here)
- `devices::audio::QTonePlay`: structure moved out of `devices::audio::TonePlayer`
- `devices::audio::TonePlayer`: additional template parameter `TONE_PLAY` (either `TonePlay` or `QTonePlay`; now a `TonePlayer` instance can only play one type of `TONE_PLAY`.

All features have been tested on all supported targets.

Known bugs and requests for enhancements: https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib/issues

The platform is well documented:

- a tutorial allows developers to discover and learn the platform step by step
- FastArduino core API is documented through doxygen and documentation is published here
- FastArduino comes with many examples covering all supported features and devices

I hope you'll enjoy playing with FastArduino platform and submit enhancements you would like

FastArduino 1.2 release

I am happy to announce the 3rd major release of FastArduino platform.

Since release 1.1 (April 2019), the main changes are liste [there](https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib/releases/tag/v1.2).

Do note that the following API changes that break compatibility with programs developed with FastArduino 1.1:

- all `register_XXX()` methods but `interrupt::register_handler()` have been removed from API as now, all ISR registration 
is implicitly performed by constructors.
- `namespace PWMPin` has been replaced with `enum class PWMPin` to ensure you cannot use any `DigitalPin` when a PWM pin
is required; this allows usage of PWM pins that are linked to more than one timer (e.g. on Arduino LEONARDO and MEGA).
- `namespace InterruptPin` has been replaced with `enum class InterruptPin` to ensure you cannot use any `DigitalPin` when a
PCINT pin is required.
- `namespace ExternalInterruptPin` has been replaced with `enum class ExternalInterruptPin` to ensure you cannot use any
`DigitalPin` when an INT pin is required.

All features have been tested on all supported targets.

Known bugs and requests for enhancements: https://github.com/jfpoilpret/fast-arduino-lib/issues

The platform is well documented:

- a [tutorial](http://jfpoilpret.github.io/fast-arduino-lib/tutorial.html) allows developers to discover and learn the platform step by step
